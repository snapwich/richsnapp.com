Back in the day body text font-size on the internet used to clock in
[around an average of 12-14px](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/typographic-design-survey-best-practices-from-the-best-blogs).
Then there was
[a big push to bump it up to 16px](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake/).
Eventually Apple essentially codified this by making an annoying feature/bug where
[Safari on iOS zooms if you click on an input that is less than 16px big](https://defensivecss.dev/tip/input-zoom-safari/).
Since I was so often working on mobile web apps that kind of cemented _my_ font-sizing around 16px ever since which is
why this site has always had a base font size of 16px. But now I am old, and my eyesight is getting worse so it's time
for a change... So I'll bump it up a little,
[but not too much](https://web.archive.org/web/20200407034219/https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1247368447622701058).
