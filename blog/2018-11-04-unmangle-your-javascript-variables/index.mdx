import Unmangler from "./Unmangler.vue";

There are many tools you can find for [unminifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming))
javascript code.  However, _most_ of these tools just add proper formatting and call it a day. Considering
many minifiers [mangle](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#cli-mangle-options) local identifiers to one or two
characters and _reuse_ those identifiers frequently, this can result in some code that is still quite painful to read.
I think we can do better.

I've created this online tool to not only format code (using [prettier](https://prettier.io/)), but
also go one step further by marking global variables and renaming mangled variables to be globally unique.
It does this by renaming each variable to its type and the line number where it was defined (e.g.
`let let99_ = 10;` if defined on line 99). The underscore helps differentiate `let 9_` vs `let 99_` when searching.
Unmangling as a module vs script will determine whether top-level variable definitions are unmangled or not.

Give it a shot below or use the <a href="/tools/code-unmangler">full-screen version here</a>.
If you think there's a better way to do this, found a bug, or think a feature would be easy to add,
send a comment or >pull-request my way!
