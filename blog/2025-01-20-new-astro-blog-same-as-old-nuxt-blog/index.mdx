This blog was created with Nuxt 2 [seven years ago](/blog/2018/01-07-we-have-a-blog) and served me well but in that time
I have been working professionally with vanilla Javascript/Typescript, Vue, and now React. I have also been playing
around with Svelte and Solid.js. Given my desire to constantly be learning and experimenting with new technologies it
seemed time to use a static-site generator that would accommodate all of the above... Enter
[Astro](https://astro.build/)! So welcome to my mostly-the-same-looking site that is now completely different!

Astro is a static site generator that allows you to use multiple frontend component frameworks within the same project,
or even page, by turning the various sections of your page into interactive
[islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/). It can server-render these components or allow you to bundle
them into your page for client-side interactivity. It also includes its own server-rendered
[Astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) which are great for basic functionality and
page layouts. Finally, it has a concept of
[Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) which allows me to continue writing
[my posts](https://github.com/snapwich/richsnapp.com) in Markdown and aggregate them simply for my index and tag
specific pages.

## The process

The steps I had to go through went something like this:

- Refactored [Nuxt layouts](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/directory-structure/layouts) to Astro components.
- Refactored my [Nuxt pages directory](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/directory-structure/pages) to Astro-compatible
  [page routes](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing).
- Refactored my [Single-File Component](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html) posts to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
  files. (This involved breaking some pages into multiple files, like css modules, js modules, etc).
- Refactored my index and tag pages from using a custom content-globbing webpack plugin I wrote to using Astro's
  [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
- Converted my various Nuxt plugins to Astro components (such as Disqus, share buttons, Google Analytics, etc).
- Updated my code blocks from using highlight.js for syntax highlighting to using
  [Astro's built-in code block syntax highlighting](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/syntax-highlighting/).
- Refactored away my old Vue 2 lightbox dependency to using
  [a vanilla js capable lightbox library](https://lightgalleryjs.com/) inside an Astro component since many pages will
  not be Vue, let alone Vue 2.

Some additional things I did since I was already deep into the refactoring groove:

- Switched from NPM to [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) to allow specific pages to have specific dependencies and slim down my
  site's shared-bundle sizes.
- Migrated my existing Vue components from Vue 2 to Vue 3.
- Added light / dark mode (click on the sun/moon to try it out!) <DarkModeSwitch />
- Added images to the preview blurbs on my index and tag pages.
- Refactored my layouts into more
  [composable parts vs a master layout that used conditional rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance).
  (What a nightmare that layout became)
- Moved from [ShareThis library share buttons](https://sharethis.com/) to static [AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com/)
  links.

## Some things I got for basically free

Since this is now an Astro site no-longer using my dated and custom webpack plugin that was coupled to Nuxt 2 I am now
able to use some out-of-the-box features that Astro provides to create things such as:

- [A sitemap](https://www.richsnapp.com/sitemap-0.xml)
- [An RSS feed](/rss.xml)
- [Automatically optimized images](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/)
- Custom images for article previews and sharing (not really a specific feature, but dead-simple with Astro's content
  collections). [Compare](https://web.archive.org/web/20241126052507/http://richsnapp.com/) and
  [contrast](https://www.richsnapp.com)
- The ability to have pages that can run basically any type of frontend framework. (Expect some blog pages with React
  components coming soon!)
- A bug-free build and mostly-painless upgrade experience. My webpack plugin for generating my Nuxt content worked,
  however it had some annoying bugs... I was stuck sometimes needing to build multiple times because of a webpack loader
  race-condition that I never took the time to solve; and it was coupled pretty heavily to Nuxt 2 since it modified
  Nuxt's generated code to inject meta content into rendered pages. The plugin was the main reason I never upgraded to
  Vue 3, Nuxt 3, or Vite.

## Thinking in Astro

The biggest mind-shift and friction with this refactor is changing my thinking around
[how I handle javascript in my static rendered components](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#common-script-patterns).
Component instances all share a single run of their &lt;script /&gt; tags which doesn't always seem intuitive. So make
sure you remember the common patterns linked above, use a web component if you need to run instance-specific code in the
browser, and realize there will be a strong boundary between server and browser code (ultimately a good tradeoff that
still includes some ways to cross the boundary when needed).

The biggest gotcha that I kept running into is including components (both Astro or other) and having them do nothing
with no errors. If that happens consider where the code is running (server, browser, frontmatter, astro component, web
component, etc) and remember that you may need
[client directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/) to accomplish some of your component's
goals.

## Things I still have to do

There is one thing I still need to do to call this refactor a complete success, and that is to add back
[offline support](/blog/2023/05-28-new-pwa-tools-section) to my [PWA tools](https://www.richsnapp.com/tools). I was
using [Nuxt-PWA](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/), but I am obviously not using that anymore. But even with Nuxt-PWA and
[Workbox](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/workbox) I had bugs that I only became aware of after-the-fact when I would push
updates... It turns out caching only a portion of your site's hashed assets is kind of complicated when your site is
built as a whole package. So I'll figure that problem out (I will probably be utilizing PNPM to build my Tools pages
separately so they can be cached as a whole) and maybe even write about how I solved it.

Thanks for checking my new site out, I hope you like it!
