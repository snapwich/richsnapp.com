One of the most important features that a website can have is a method to effectively search its content. There's no
denying that there's such an overload of information on websites these days that helping people find what they need can
be a monumental task. That's where a _well designed_ site searching functionality can swoop in to save the day and today
I'm going to show _you_ how to deploy this superhero feature on your very own static website, no backend required.

Now you're probably saying to yourself "This guy barely has any content on his website... does he really need search
functionality? Can't his visitors [_sic_] just hit `Ctrl-F` or `âŒ˜-F`?" However, you would be remiss in reminding
yourself that not all users are technical, nor do they all possess the appropriate number of digits required to
simultaneous press two keys. Then you might say to me "Hey buddy, your site is already indexed by google... Why can't
your users just go to Google and search for what they want there?" to which I'd respond: please hold all your questions
and feedback until the end.

Now that we've clarified the _why_, let's work on the _how_ and jump right in! We know that Google is the king of
search, so we'll kick off this project by discovering what products they have available to solve our problem for us.
We'll do this by [typing exactly what we want into google.com](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=google+search+site), clicking
search, and then clicking on the first link. While you may choose to simplify the process with the _I'm feeling lucky_
button, I find the added work of a multi-step process can often pay dividends in the feelings-of-accomplishment
department.

Straight out of the gate we'll see that Google has a tool with a feature list capable of scratching our every itch:
[Google Site Search](https://enterprise.google.com/search/products/gss.html). However, before getting too excited it's
important to scan _every_ Google product page for the ominous shutdown notice, and with our cursory glance we'll see
that our product is indeed deprecated. An unfortunate sight, but rather than being filled with disappointment we should
consider the hours we might have poured into the ill-fated Google product had we been unaware of the impending shutdown.

</figure>

Repeating our search again with "Google Site Search Alternatives" will lead us to another, slightly less spectacular
solution: [Google Custom Search](http://www.google.com/cse). While lacking many of the bells and whistles of our first
solution, it does provide search; and with the claims of basic configuration and a copy/paste installation, the setup
process seems simple enough. Let's give it a shot.

We'll create a little spot at the top of our page for the &lt;gcse:searchbox-only&gt; tag, paste the `cse.js` loading
javascript snippet somewhere into the document, and away we go!

</figure>

It's a thing of beauty, isn't it...? I figured it'd take some work to get it looking the way we wanted, but this thing
just looks plain broken... Let's dig into the DOM that was added to our site to see what created this monstrosity.

<figure class="scale">
  <img src={imgGoogleDom.src} />
</figure>

The first thing you may notice is that this thing was inserted directly into our page. No
[shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM) (which is odd, considering Google's
push for modern [Web Components](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview)), not even an
iFrame; it's just... out there. You may also notice this thing is still using _all kinds_ of html tags (including the
classic [`table` layout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html)).

What's wrong with the above? Well, many web designers these days use
[CSS resets](https://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/) to start from a blank slate when creating their website. In my
case, I'm using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which includes
[Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) (similar to a reset, but not quite), so when our site's CSS
defaults cascade into the search widget we are left with something that most would describe as awful. At
[Needle](http://www.needle.com), while working on their in-the-page chat, I solved problems like this by using only
`div` tags wherever possible and namespacing all class names (e.g. `<div class=".needle-h1">`, which Google does do
here, luckily). Additionally, I created a container for our widget that instituted css defaults similar to
[cleanslate.css](http://cleanslatecss.com/) which guarded against most cascading and universal selector issues that
could affect our widget. Since we don't have control over the Google search widget in this case, we'll have to find
another solution to this problem.

Google Custom Search touts customization, but looking at the customization panel will reveal that it's mostly just color
and font-size changes; and currently our search has a few more problems than a simple color problem. Let's see if we can
manually fix our problem and add some better styling while we're at it.

<figure class="smallest right">
```less
// Just a little bit of styling...
.search-box {
  margin-right: 0;
  color: @gray-dark;
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  border-bottom: 2px solid @gray-lighter;
  min-height: 30px;
  line-height: normal;
  a {
    font-size: inherit;
  }
  *, *:after, *:before {
    box-sizing: content-box;
  }
  .gsc-control-searchbox-only {
    border: 0 !important;
    padding: 0 !important;
    background: transparent !important;
    .gsc-search-box {
      margin-bottom: 0 !important;
      * {
        background: transparent !important;
        box-shadow: none !important;
      }
      .gsc-input-box {
        border: 0 !important;
      }
      input {
        color: @gray-lighter;
        border: 0 !important;
        appearance: textfield;
        border-radius: 0;
        text-indent: 0 !important;
      }
      td {
        vertical-align: bottom;
        padding-left: 0;
        padding-right: 0;
      }
      .gsc-search-button {
        display: none;
      }
      .gsib_b {
        display: none;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</figure>

With some javascript to clear the placeholder text and a slight smattering of `!important` tags we end up with something
that looks like it belongs on our site a little bit better:

<img class={`bordered-content ${styles["styled-search"]} `} src={imgStyledSearch.src} />

A respectable looking search bar, if I do say so myself.

Normally I avoid the `!important` modifier like the plague, however in this case it becomes somewhat of a necessity due
to Google's use of the `style` attribute to directly style some elements along with a few other
[specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) battles involved with the process.

At this point some of you may be wondering what happens if Google ends up changing the html markup or styling of their
widget... Couldn't it end up looking even worse than it did originally? Couldn't it end up looking something like this?

<div class={`bordered-content ${styles["messed-up-search"]}`}>
  <input disabled type="text" id="messedUpSearchText" />
  <button disabled>
    <i class="fa fa-search"></i>
  </button>
</div>

Yes, yes it could. However, it looks like that's just the risk we're going to have to take. Code doesn't update that
frequently these days, right? And it's always backwards compatible when it does!

We haven't checked out the search results page yet; I wonder what that looks like? Google Custom Search has a nice
overlay option which means we don't have to worry about where the results will fit into our page and it ends up looking
pretty good on my desktop machine. Let's see how it looks on a mobile device... It is 2018 and everything is
[responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) these days, so hopefully Google has implemented some
sort of responsive behavior.

<figure class="center scale">
  <img src={imgIphoneSearch.src} />
  <figcaption>Mobile leaves something to be desired</figcaption>
</figure>

Optimistic as I was that we were almost done, it looks like we have a problem... In addition to looking pretty bad, the
mobile results don't scroll properly; and unfortunately for an overlay that decides to shove all the ads above the fold
this basically renders our search results as a giant popup advertisement on mobile devices. Google Custom Search does
have a configuration option that allows us to open the search results in a separate page... but then how is that better
than just manually redirecting our visitors to a google search results page to begin with?

<div class={styles["lightbulb"]} v-repaint>
  <svg width="140" height="140">
    <line stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="5" stroke="currentColor" x1="40" y1="110" x2="20" y2="125" />
    <line stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="5" stroke="currentColor" x1="30" y1="80" x2="5" y2="80" />
    <line stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="5" stroke="currentColor" x1="40" y1="50" x2="20" y2="35" />
    <line stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="5" stroke="currentColor" x1="70" y1="15" x2="70" y2="40" />
    <line stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="5" stroke="currentColor" x1="100" y1="50" x2="120" y2="35" />
    <line stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="5" stroke="currentColor" x1="110" y1="80" x2="135" y2="80" />
    <line stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="5" stroke="currentColor" x1="100" y1="110" x2="120" y2="125" />
  </svg>
  <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i>
</div>

Wait, that's _genius_! We can give our visitors the same experience they would have had with Google Custom Search
(without any of the headache and third-party code inclusions) by just creating a search box that manually redirects them
to a pre-populated Google search results page.

<figure class={`${styles['search-figure']} center`}>
  ```html
  <template>
    <div class="google-search">
      <button @click="search(text)">
        <i class="fa fa-search"></i>
      </button>
      <input ref="input"
             title="Site Search"
             v-on:keyup.13="search(text)"
             v-model="text" />
    </div>
  </template>

  <script>
    export default {
      props: [
        'site'
      ],
      data() {
        return {
          text: ''
        }
      },
      methods: {
        search(str) {
          if (str) {
            window.open([
              'https://www.google.com/search?q=',
              this.site ? 'site:' + this.site + '+' : '',
              encodeURIComponent(str)
            ].join(''));
          } else {
            this.$refs.input.focus();
          }
        }
      }
    }
  </script>

```
</figure>

<figure class="center">
<div class={styles['google-search']}><GoogleSearch client:load site="richsnapp.com"></GoogleSearch></div>
<figcaption>Our google search vue component</figcaption>
</figure>

Simple, effective, and overall works well enough!  It even has less ads, for whatever reason.  I think we have a
winner!

And that is how you add google search to a static website!
